/*
 * The service worker: what lets the home-screen app open like an app.
 *
 * Deliberately small, because a service worker that caches the wrong thing
 * keeps serving yesterday's build after a deploy:
 *
 *   - Pages (navigations) go to the network first, so a deploy is seen on the
 *     next open; the last page kept is used when there is no network, or when
 *     the network has not answered in two seconds, so the app still opens on
 *     a lift, a flight or a slow line.
 *   - /assets/ files are named by their contents (the build hashes them), so a
 *     cached one can never be stale; they are served from the cache and kept.
 *   - Everything else — the database, Microsoft, maps — is not touched.
 *
 * Bump VERSION to drop every cache on the next open.
