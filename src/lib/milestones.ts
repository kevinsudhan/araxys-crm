 * The customer's milestones (102): what the tracking page shows, and what the

 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ONE LIST, RECORDED BY A PERSON
 *
 * Booking confirmed, picked up, received, customs, sailed, arrived, out for
 * delivery, delivered — per mode, copied onto each job — plus any update the
 * desk writes itself. A milestone is reached when somebody records it: the
 * day, the time if known, where, a note. Nothing else moves it, and the
 * customer's page shows nothing else about progress.
 *
 * THE TIMES ARE AS TOLD
 *
 * "Sailed 27 Sep, 14:30" is the port's time, the way a line or an agent
 * reports it, and is kept and shown as typed — not converted to India's
 * time, which would put a Jebel Ali arrival an hour and a half out.
 *
 * WHAT THE CUSTOMER SEES, IN ORDER
 *
 * What has happened, oldest first by when it happened; then what is still to
 * come, in the list's order. A milestone nobody recorded but that a later one
 * has overtaken ("out for delivery" when "delivered" is recorded) is passed:
 * showing it as still to come would say the cargo is going backwards.
