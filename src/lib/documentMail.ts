/**
 * Sending a document from the Documents list (6 Oct): who it goes to, under
 * what subject, and the few lines around the PDF.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHO
 *
 * Most documents are the customer's: the booking confirmation, the draft and
 * final B/L, the cargo receipt, the invoices, the proof of delivery. The
 * arrival notice and the delivery order are the consignee's, at the far end.
 * The shipping instructions and the VGM go to the line. The address is only
 * the first suggestion: the compose window's To is the desk's to change.
 *
 * A DRAFT
 *
 * A document still missing details goes as the stamped draft naming them,
 * and the mail says so and asks for them: that draft is how the desk chases
 * what is missing. Never sent as though it were the final one.
